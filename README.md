# Flix

Flix is a movie and TV show discovery tool. It interacts with the TMDb API to display new, popular, highly rated, and upcoming media. There is also a randomiser tool that takes in two paramters: content type (Movie or TV show) and minimum TMDb rating. The randomiser then makes suggestions based on these two parameters.

Flix was created using `React(Js)` and `TailwindCSS`
